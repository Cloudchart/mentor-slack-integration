        <p>2&nbsp;Purpose</p>
        <p>2.1 This Policy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;statement of&nbsp;how the Service may collect, use and aggregate personal information about customers on&nbsp;the Service website. </p>
        <p>2.2 Our Service respects personal privacy of&nbsp;customers and is&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;protecting&nbsp;it.</p>
        <p>3&nbsp;Pursuing a&nbsp;Legitimate Aim</p>
        <p>3.1&nbsp;We believe that our Service presses social needs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;democratic society, serves public interests or&nbsp;the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;others, and brings additional business value to&nbsp;our customers.</p>
        <p>4&nbsp;How We&nbsp;Collect, Process, and Keep Personal Information of&nbsp;Our Customers</p>
        <p>4.1 Our cooperation with customers is&nbsp;twofold: (1) we&nbsp;provide them with services, and (2) for that purpose collect and process customers’ relevant personal information.</p>
        <p>4.2 The processing of&nbsp;Personal Data may constitute an&nbsp;interference with the right to&nbsp;respect for private life of&nbsp;our customers. The right to&nbsp;respect for private life&nbsp;is, however, not an&nbsp;absolute right but must be&nbsp;balanced against and reconciled with other legitimate interests be&nbsp;they of&nbsp;other persons (private interests) or&nbsp;of&nbsp;society as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole (public interests).</p>
        <p>5&nbsp;Key Principles of&nbsp;Personal Information Protection</p>
        <p>5.1 The key principles for collecting, processing and keeping personal information upon which our interference is&nbsp;justified are laid out in&nbsp;this section 3&nbsp;below.</p>
        <p>5.2 <strong><strong>The Principle of&nbsp;Lawful Processing</strong></strong></p>
        <p>(i) We&nbsp;collect, process and keep personal information received from our customers in&nbsp;accordance with the Applicable Law.</p>
        <p>(ii) We&nbsp;always pursue a&nbsp;legitimate purpose while collecting, processing and keeping personal information.</p>
        <p>(iii) We&nbsp;collect, process and keep personal information to&nbsp;the extent as&nbsp;reasonably necessary in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;achieve our business goals and render our services to&nbsp;the benefit of&nbsp;customers. Personal Data of&nbsp;our customers shall be&nbsp;not elicited, collected, processed and/or kept without need or&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;a&nbsp;reasonable purpose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p>
        <p>5.3 <strong><strong>The Principle of&nbsp;Purpose Specification and Limitation</strong></strong></p>
        <p>(i) The purpose of&nbsp;processing Personal Data shall be&nbsp;explicitly defined before processing is&nbsp;started.</p>
        <p>(ii) No&nbsp;processing for undefined purposes of&nbsp;collected personal information is&nbsp;permissible for our Service.</p>
        <p>(iii) Further use of&nbsp;Personal Data for another purpose shall always be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;consent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer unless the new purpose of&nbsp;processing is&nbsp;incompatible with the original one.</p>
        <p>(iv) Transfer of&nbsp;personal information to&nbsp;third parties is&nbsp;always taken as&nbsp;a&nbsp;new purpose and may be&nbsp;effected subject to&nbsp;consent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer only.</p>
        <p>5.4 <strong><strong>Data Quality Principles</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The principles of&nbsp;data quality must be&nbsp;implemented by&nbsp;the controller in&nbsp;all processing operations. </p>
        <p>(i) <strong><strong>The limited retention of&nbsp;data principle.</strong></strong> It&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;delete data as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;they are no&nbsp;longer needed for the purposes for which they were collected. Personal Data are kept in&nbsp;a&nbsp;form which permits identification of&nbsp;customers for no&nbsp;longer than is&nbsp;necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or&nbsp;for which they are further processed. The data must therefore be&nbsp;erased when those purposes have been served. Exemptions from the principle of&nbsp;limited retention must be&nbsp;set out by&nbsp;law and need special safeguards for the protection of&nbsp;customers as&nbsp;data subjects.</p>
        <p>(ii) <strong><strong>The data relevancy principle</strong></strong>. Only such data shall be&nbsp;processed as&nbsp;are adequate, relevant and not excessive in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;the purpose for which they are collected and/or further processed. The categories of&nbsp;data chosen for processing must be&nbsp;necessary in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;achieve the declared overall aim of&nbsp;the processing operations, and the Service should strictly limit collection of&nbsp;data to&nbsp;such information as&nbsp;is&nbsp;directly relevant for the specific purpose pursued by&nbsp;the processing.</p>
        <p>(iii) <strong><strong>The data accuracy principle</strong></strong>. The Service shall not use personal information about its customers without taking steps to&nbsp;ensure with reasonable certainty that the data are accurate and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;date.</p>
        <p>5.5 <strong><strong>Fair Processing Principle</strong></strong></p>
        <p>The principle of&nbsp;fair processing governs primarily the relationship between the Service and customers.</p>
        <p>(i) <strong><strong>Transparency.</strong></strong> This principle establishes an&nbsp;obligation for the Service to&nbsp;keep the customers informed about how their data are being used.</p>
        <p>(ii) <strong><strong>Establishing trust</strong></strong>. The Service should document, to&nbsp;customers and to&nbsp;the general public, that it&nbsp;will process data in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawful and transparent manner. Processing operations must not be&nbsp;performed in&nbsp;secret and should not have unforeseeable negative effects. The Service so&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible shall act in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way which promptly complies with the wishes of&nbsp;the customer, especially where his or&nbsp;her consent forms the legal basis for the data processing.</p>
        <p>5.6 <strong><strong>Principle of&nbsp;Accountability</strong></strong></p>
        <p>This principle applies to&nbsp;the effect that the Service should be&nbsp;accountable for complying with measures which give effect to&nbsp;the principles stated above.</p>
        <p>6&nbsp;Service Website Administration and Accounts</p>
        <p>6.1 The Service and Service website are administrated by&nbsp;the Company. For that purpose the Company shall appoint an&nbsp;Administrator.</p>
        <p>6.2 The Administrator is&nbsp;responsible for compliance of&nbsp;the Service website activities with this Policy.</p>
        <p>6.3 The Service is&nbsp;not allowed to&nbsp;transfer or&nbsp;disseminate any Personal Data kept on&nbsp;its customers’ accounts.</p>
        <p>6.4 Any contribution made by&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer may be&nbsp;deleted by&nbsp;the Administrator if&nbsp;such a&nbsp;contribution violates or&nbsp;may potentially violate other customer or&nbsp;customers’ civil rights or&nbsp;dignity.</p>
        <p>6.5&nbsp;In the event that a&nbsp;customer has decided to&nbsp;leave the Service, his/her account and all information stored on&nbsp;such account shall be&nbsp;immediately and entirely deleted by&nbsp;the Service.</p>
        <p>6.6&nbsp;At the discretion of&nbsp;the Administrator some of&nbsp;Personal Data may be&nbsp;made ‘anonymous’ after a&nbsp;certain period of&nbsp;time, some may be&nbsp;deleted entirely after a&nbsp;certain period of&nbsp;time, and some may be&nbsp;maintained in&nbsp;perpetuity.</p>
        <p>6.7 Accounts which remain unattended for 24&nbsp;months shall be&nbsp;entirely deleted without notice.</p>
        <p>6.8 The data posted by&nbsp;customers shall be&nbsp;treated as&nbsp;public information unless such data have been posted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;Verified Customer.</p>
        <p>6.9 Any customer is&nbsp;entitled to&nbsp;communicate with the Administrator. </p>
        <p>6.10 Customers who are dissatisfied by&nbsp;the Service’s compliance to&nbsp;this Policy can submit complaints to&nbsp;the Administrator.</p>
        <p>6.11 Neither the Company or&nbsp;the Administrator nor the Service are responsible for the use of&nbsp;customers’ personal information collected by&nbsp;Third Parties whose links may be&nbsp;placed on&nbsp;the Service website from time to&nbsp;time.</p>
        <p>7&nbsp;Information Automatically or&nbsp;Periodically Collected</p>
        <p>7.1 For each visitor to&nbsp;the Service website, the Service servers may automatically collect information about the pages visited by&nbsp;such a&nbsp;visitor and the&nbsp;IP address or&nbsp;domain name of&nbsp;visitors. That information will be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;help diagnose problems with the Service server, and to&nbsp;administer the Service website. Visitor’s IP&nbsp;address is&nbsp;not linked to&nbsp;personally (identifiable) information but will be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;gather broad demographic information. This information helps the Service tailor and improve our business on&nbsp;the Service website.</p>
        <p>7.2 The Service does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of&nbsp;13.</p>
        <p>7.3 The Service may conduct periodic online surveys. For example, visitors to&nbsp;the Service website may see a&nbsp;pop-up window asking them to&nbsp;voluntarily participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;user survey.</p>
        <p>7.4 The Service automatically collects&nbsp;IP addresses and web site usage information from customers when they visit the Service website. This information helps the Service evaluate how its visitors use and navigate the Service website on&nbsp;an&nbsp;aggregate basis, including the number and frequency of&nbsp;visitors to&nbsp;each web page, the length of&nbsp;their visits, their browser type and their operating systems.</p>
        <p>7.5 Information that is&nbsp;so&nbsp;collected may be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;the following ways:</p>
        <p>(i) To&nbsp;improve existing features or&nbsp;develop new features, products and services by&nbsp;analyzing how site features are being used.</p>
        <p>(ii) To&nbsp;award prizes in&nbsp;contests or&nbsp;promotions. Participation in&nbsp;some contests or&nbsp;promotions may require visitors to&nbsp;agree to&nbsp;be&nbsp;contacted by&nbsp;the Service.</p>
        <p>(iii) To&nbsp;provide advertisers or&nbsp;other Third Parties with aggregate information about the Service customer base and usage patterns. Personally identifiable information is&nbsp;kept private and not distributed to&nbsp;Third Parties.</p>
        <p>7.6 The Service may place a&nbsp;“cookie”; on&nbsp;the browser of&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer’s computer. Cookies are pieces of&nbsp;information that a&nbsp;web site transfers to&nbsp;the customer’s computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. The use of&nbsp;cookies is&nbsp;common in&nbsp;the Internet industry, and many major web sites use them to&nbsp;provide useful features to&nbsp;their customers. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information, but may be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;tell when the customer’s computer has contacted the Service website. The Service uses the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as&nbsp;delivery of&nbsp;features and advertisements, so&nbsp;that the Service can customize delivery of&nbsp;information specific to&nbsp;your interests without compromising privacy. The Service also may use cookies to&nbsp;save a&nbsp;customers’ logins and passwords so&nbsp;they don’t have to&nbsp;re-enter it&nbsp;each time they visit portions of&nbsp;the Service website.</p>
        <p>7.7 The Service also may collect demographic and profile data from customers as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the registration process (i.e., postal code, sex, income level, interest in&nbsp;certain topics). The Service may use this data to&nbsp;tailor a&nbsp;customer’s experience at&nbsp;the Service website, showing the customer content the Service may think the customer might be&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in, displaying the content according to&nbsp;the customer’s preferences and informing him/her of&nbsp;upcoming events on&nbsp;the Service website. The Service also share certain demographic and profile data with advertisers and business partners on&nbsp;an&nbsp;aggregated basis.</p>
        <p>8&nbsp;Verified Customers</p>
        <p>8.1 The Service requires voluntary registration in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;utilize specific features. These forms may require a&nbsp;customer to&nbsp;give to&nbsp;the Service some of&nbsp;his/her Personal Data, which may include contact information and unique identifiers. If&nbsp;the customer so&nbsp;signify beforehand, the Service may use his/her contact information from the registration form to&nbsp;send to&nbsp;such customer promotional material from some of&nbsp;the Company’s partners. Unique identifiers are collected only for use as&nbsp;account numbers in&nbsp;our record system. The Service does not disclose any unique identifiers to&nbsp;any Third Parties.</p>
        <p>8.2 The information collected from these registration forms is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;improve existing features or&nbsp;develop new features, products and services by&nbsp;analyzing how site features are being used. Such information may be&nbsp;shared with Third Parties on&nbsp;an&nbsp;aggregate basis.</p>
        <p>9&nbsp;Disclosure</p>
        <p>9.1 The Service will disclose account information only in&nbsp;special cases, such&nbsp;as (i) to&nbsp;comply with valid legal requirements, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or&nbsp;court order; or&nbsp;(ii) when the Company has reason to&nbsp;believe that disclosing this information is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;identify, contact or&nbsp;bring legal action against someone who, intentionally or&nbsp;unintentionally, may be&nbsp;causing injury or&nbsp;harm to&nbsp;the Service customers or&nbsp;other persons or&nbsp;violating the Terms of&nbsp;Service of&nbsp;the Service website.</p>
        <p>10&nbsp;Links to&nbsp;other sites</p>
        <p>10.1 The Service website may contain links to&nbsp;other sites. The Service is&nbsp;not responsible for the privacy practices or&nbsp;the content of&nbsp;such websites, including any sites that may indicate a&nbsp;special relationship or&nbsp;partnership with the Service (such as&nbsp;co-branded pages and “powered&nbsp;by” relationships) or&nbsp;the sites of&nbsp;the Service’s advertisers that customers go&nbsp;to&nbsp;by&nbsp;clicking on&nbsp;a&nbsp;banner ad&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Service website. The Service does not disclose unique identifiers to&nbsp;those responsible for the linked sites. The linked sites, however, may collect personal information from customers when they link to&nbsp;their site. This collecting of&nbsp;information is&nbsp;not subject to&nbsp;the Service’s control. To&nbsp;ensure protection of&nbsp;customers’ privacy, the customers are recommended to&nbsp;always review the privacy policy of&nbsp;the sites they visit by&nbsp;linking from the Service website.</p>
        <p>11&nbsp;Advertisements</p>
        <p>11.1 The Service may display advertisements on&nbsp;the Service website. These ads may contain cookies. The Service does not have access to&nbsp;this information, nor does control its use. The Service does not provide any personally identifiable data regarding customers to&nbsp;its advertisers.</p>
        <p>12&nbsp;Security</p>
        <p>12.1 The Service website has security measures in&nbsp;place to&nbsp;protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of&nbsp;the information under the Service’s control.</p>
        <p>13&nbsp;E-mail Notices</p>
        <p>13.1 The Service may send notices via e-mail to&nbsp;Verified Customers who post and/or bookmark reviews and comments. These e-mails include but are not limited to&nbsp;confirmations that an&nbsp;item has been posted, notices that the item has received a&nbsp;reply, and notices that the listing has been deleted by&nbsp;the Administrator. These e-mails are a&nbsp;necessary feature for the Service.</p>
        <p>14&nbsp;Customer’s role in&nbsp;protecting his/her privacy</p>
        <p>14.1&nbsp;If a&nbsp;customer shares a&nbsp;computer terminal with others, he/she may want to&nbsp;consider establishing an&nbsp;anonymous e-mail account. In&nbsp;this way, e-mails that such a&nbsp;customer receives from the Service, such as&nbsp;password reminders will be&nbsp;seen only by&nbsp;the customer. If&nbsp;the customer accesses the Service through an&nbsp;e-mail account maintained by&nbsp;his/her employer, he/she has to&nbsp;note that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible that the employer may monitor the customer’s e-mail communications.</p>
        <p>15&nbsp;Notification of&nbsp;changes</p>
        <p>15.1 This Policy may be&nbsp;revised over time as&nbsp;new features are added to&nbsp;the Service or&nbsp;as&nbsp;Internet security and privacy standards evolve. The Service will make readily available to&nbsp;customers information about any changes to&nbsp;this Policy and shall be&nbsp;posted at&nbsp;the Service website homepage for a&nbsp;certain period of&nbsp;time after such changes have been implemented.</p>
        <p>16&nbsp;Correcting and updating information</p>
        <p>16.1 The Service also permits a&nbsp;Verified Customer to&nbsp;correct or&nbsp;update his/her Personal Data previously provided to&nbsp;the Service. Such corrections and updates may be&nbsp;effected via customer’s access to&nbsp;his/her account.</p>
        <p>17&nbsp;Customer’s acceptance of&nbsp;these terms</p>
        <p>17.1&nbsp;By using the Service website, a&nbsp;customer signifies his/her acceptance of&nbsp;the terms of&nbsp;this Policy. If&nbsp;the customer does not agree to&nbsp;the terms of&nbsp;this Policy, he/she is&nbsp;kindly requested to&nbsp;abstain from using the Service website and exit the site immediately. The customer’s continued use of&nbsp;the Service website following the posting of&nbsp;changes to&nbsp;these terms will mean that such customer accepts those changes.</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>18.1 Any questions, queries and other communications shall be&nbsp;made at&nbsp;any time by&nbsp;sending electronic mail to support@getmentorbot.com</p>
